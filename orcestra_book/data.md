### Supporting data
#### Numerical simulations - Limited area model

To support the campaign, we performed daily hindcasts of the atmospheric conditions in the campaign region. The whole dataset is stored on the supercomputer [Levante](https://docs.dkrz.de/doc/levante/index.html) hosted by the DKRZ and is accessible on demand. It comprises of high-sampling rate 2D and 3D snapshots of key variables.

Visualisations of individual variables for each day are given [here](lam.md). An example of such a visualisation is shown below.
